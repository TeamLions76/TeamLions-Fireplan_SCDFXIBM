# Fireplan

## Team Lions
By Lee Yin Jie, Tan Ying, Ho Hol Yin

We are a group of students from SUTD (Architecture) and NUS (Industrial Design and Computer Science)

## Problem description
Fires are a key concern of the SCDF. Being a phenomenon that occurs almost instantaneously without any warning and has a potential to quickly spiral out of control, we identified such situations to require an immediate response. We intend to use technology to make sense of data collected from state-of-the-art sensors and use these data to educate and inform people.

Our technological solution: **Fireplan**.

**Fireplan** is a fire awareness and detection app with in households. This app also plays an educational role in informing members of the household the potential fire hotspots in their house and the respective extinguishers that they might require.
