# Fireplan

## Team Lions
By Lee Yin Jie, Tan Ying, Ho Hol Yin

We are a group of students from SUTD (Architecture) and NUS (Industrial Design and Computer Science)

## Problem description
Fires are a key concern of the SCDF. Being a phenomenon that occurs almost instantaneously without any warning and has a potential to quickly spiral out of control, we identified such situations to require an immediate response. We intend to use technology to make sense of data collected from state-of-the-art sensors and use these data to educate and inform people.

Our technological solution: **Fireplan**.

**Fireplan** is a fire awareness and detection app with in households. On normal days, it is an educational tool which inform members of the household the potential fire hotspots in their house and the respective extinguishers that they might require. 

It plays a pro-active role in early fire detection and firefighting. Using smart sensors, such as heat, smoke level and air quality sensor Fireplan will be able to analyse the everyday data collected and raise an alert when there is abnormality. This offers early detection of potential fire and guide household member to put out fire before the situation worsens.
